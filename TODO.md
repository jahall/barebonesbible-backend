## User Bugs
* [FIXED] A small typo to report this morning in the Hebrew of 2 Samuel 3.2. - the first 6 consonants of the text are repeated, and run into the following word (to David)


## Nice-to-have
1. Ignore stopwords for english
2. Fix undefined issue
3. Populate strongs definitions (store in separate table initially)
4. Create modals
5. Bring lambda api code into codebase (and possibly autodeploy...)
6. Greek!
7. (STRETCH!) Statistical correlation highlighting of Hebrew/Greek
8. Call it a day!
